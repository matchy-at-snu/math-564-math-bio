\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Consider the difference equation
    \[
        x_{n+2} - 3x_{n+1} + 2x_n = 0.
    \]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that the general solution to this equation is
        \[
            x_n = A_1 + 2^n A_2
        \]
        Now suppose that $x_0 = 10$ and $x_1 = 20$. Then $A_1$ and $A_2$ must
        satisfy the system of equations
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                A_1 + 2^0 A_2 = x_0 = 10,\\
                A_1 + 2^1 A_2 = x_1 = 20.
            \end{aligned}
        \]
    \item Solve for $A_1$ and $A_2$ and find the solution to the above
    \textit{initial value problem}.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The characteristic solution is \[
            \lambda^2 - 3 \lambda + 2 = 0
        \]
        The characterictic roots are \[
            \lambda_1 = 1, \quad \lambda_2 = 2.
        \]
        By the principle of linear superposition, the general solution is indeed \[
            x_n = A_1 + 2^n A_2
        \]
        \item Solving the system of equations
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                A_1 + 2^0 A_2 = x_0 = 10,\\
                A_1 + 2^1 A_2 = x_1 = 20.
            \end{aligned}
        \] gives \[
            A_1 = 0, \quad A_2 = 10.
        \]
        Therefore, the solution should be \[
            x_n = 10 \cdot 2^n
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
