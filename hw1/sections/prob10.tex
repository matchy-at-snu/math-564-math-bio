\begin{homeworkProblem}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider the growth of an aphid population described in Section 1.1.
        If the fractional mortality of aphids is 80\% and the sex ratio (ratio of
        females to the total number of aphids) is 50\%, what minimum fecundity $f$
        is required to prevent extinction.
        \item Establish a general condition on the fecundity of aphids to guarantee
        population growth given a fixed survivorship and a known sex ratio.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \segline
    
    \solution
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Extinction will be prevented if the growth rate $\lambda = rf(1-m)>1$.
        Solving the inequity by plugging in given values gives $f = 10$, i.e. a
        fecundity of 10 progeny per female.
        \item In general, we need $f \geq \frac{1}{r(1-m)}$
    \end{enumerate}
